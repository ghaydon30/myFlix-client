# MyFlix Client App
MyFlix is the front end of an application to provide users with basic movie descriptions, imagery, and some basic profile functions such as managing a favorite movie list. This is a project with the intent of practicing skills in React JS, as well as using the Bootstrap framework and communicating with an API I made earlier.
